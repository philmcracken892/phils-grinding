Metal Crafting Guide for Players

Welcome to Metal Crafting!

This guide explains how to use the Metal Crafting system in this RedM server. With this feature, you can craft metal bars using a grinding wheel, complete with cool animations and effects like sparks and smoke. Follow the steps below to get started!

How to Use the Metal Crafting System

1. Getting a Grinding Wheel





Obtain the Item: You need a grinding wheel item in your inventory to start crafting. Check with the server’s economy or shops to see how to get one (e.g., purchasing, quest rewards, or looting).



Place the Grinding Wheel:





Select the grinding wheel item in your inventory.



Use it to place the grinding wheel on the ground. Your character will crouch and set it up, and you’ll see a confirmation message like “Grinding wheel placed successfully.”



If it fails, you’ll get an error message (e.g., “Failed to place grinding wheel”). Make sure you’re in a clear, flat area.

2. Crafting Metal Bars





Approach the Grinding Wheel: Walk up to the placed grinding wheel. You’ll see two interaction options:





Craft Metal Bars: Opens the crafting menu.



Pick Up Grinding Wheel: Lets you pick up the wheel to move it or store it.



Open the Crafting Menu:





Select “Craft Metal Bars” when prompted (usually by pressing a key like E or F, depending on the server).



A menu will appear showing available recipes, such as different types of metal bars.



Each recipe lists the required items (e.g., “2x Iron Ore, 1x Coal”) and the item you’ll craft.



Start Crafting:





Choose a recipe from the menu.



If you have the required items, a progress bar will appear (e.g., “Crafting Iron Bar”).



Your character will perform a crafting animation, and you’ll see sparks and smoke effects on the grinding wheel.



Stay near the grinding wheel, as crafting will fail if you move too far or cancel it.



Success or Failure:





If successful, you’ll get a message like “Successfully crafted Iron Bar,” and the crafted item will be added to your inventory.



If you cancel (e.g., by moving or pressing a cancel key), you’ll see “Crafting cancelled,” and no items will be consumed.

3. Picking Up the Grinding Wheel





How to Pick It Up:





Approach the grinding wheel and select “Pick Up Grinding Wheel” when prompted.



Your character will crouch and pick it up, adding the grinding wheel item back to your inventory.



You’ll see a message like “Grinding wheel picked up” if successful, or an error if it fails (e.g., “No grinding wheel found nearby”).



Why Pick It Up?:





Move the grinding wheel to a new location.



Store it to save space or prevent others from using it.

Tips for Players





Check Your Inventory: Make sure you have the required items for a recipe before starting. The crafting menu will show what you need.



Stay Close: Don’t walk away during crafting, or it will cancel.



Clear Space: Place the grinding wheel on flat ground to avoid placement errors.



Server Rules: Some servers may have specific rules or locations for crafting, so check with the server staff or community for details.



Effects Are Cool: Enjoy the sparks and smoke while crafting—it adds to the immersive experience!

Troubleshooting





“No grinding wheel found nearby”: You’re too far from a placed grinding wheel. Move closer and try again.



“Failed to place grinding wheel”: Ensure you’re on flat ground and have the grinding wheel item in your inventory.



Crafting cancels unexpectedly: Avoid moving, sprinting, or fighting during crafting, as these will interrupt the process.



No crafting options appear: Check if you have the required items or if the server has specific conditions (e.g., a certain job or location).

Need Help?

If you run into issues or have questions, contact the server’s support team (e.g., via Discord or in-game chat). They can explain server-specific details, like where to get grinding wheels or crafting materials.

Happy crafting, and enjoy forging your metal bars!
